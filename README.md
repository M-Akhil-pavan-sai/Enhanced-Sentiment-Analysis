Our project is an extension and development of an existing project aiming to create and develop an advanced sentiment
analysis system to analyze Yelp restaurant reviews more comprehensively and accurately, including support for multiple
languages. The system will leverage state-of-the-art NLP techniques, including advanced transformer models and
hybrid architectures, to understand the nuanced sentiments expressed in reviews across different languages. It will also
incorporate multi modal data analysis to consider images and text together, aspect-based sentiment analysis for granular
insights, model explainability for transparency, and key feature of our project is a user-friendly web application that
allows users to submit reviews in various languages and receive sentiment predictions along with explanations for the
modelâ€™s decisions
